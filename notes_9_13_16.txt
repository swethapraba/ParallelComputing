/*
Decode:
Int num = 28, j;
Char tree[10101] ; /*next time we will see how to build real treenodes; make the array huge */

for(j = 0; j < 10101; j++)
{
	tree[j]  = ‘\0’; //some empty variable so you know it’s empty
}

Loop (28) //loop over num; this builds the tree
Tree[k] = symbol;

Based on:
Root = 1
K -> 2k or -> 2k+1

----------------------------- ^^^ all of this is overhead and stuff below to decode is the actual program
Next Loop: //loop over the num 28 again, this is the running and actually decoding
Root = 1
	K -> 2k or -> 2k+1
printf(“%c” , tree[j]); //printing out symbols when you actually find them

//%c is formatting for display in the console, to show the content as a character
/*s is string, f is floating point (normal) , e is scientific notation, etc. */
